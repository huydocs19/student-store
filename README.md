# Project #2: Student Store

### Deployed Application: [Student Store Deployed Site](https://free-student-store.surge.sh/)

## Overview

Selling merchandise in the modern era requires digital solutions. For this project, I designed and constructed an online student store for the College of Codepath. The application entails a frontend user interface for potential customers to peruse the goods, and a backend API to handle data management. The API will be built with Node and Express and the UI will be built with React.

### Application Features

- Displays the following sections: header, banner, search, product grid, about, contact, and footer.
- On the initial page load, display the products at the [GET /store endpoint](https://codepath-store-api.herokuapp.com/store).
- Users can sign up with their email, password, username, and name.
- Users can log in with an email and password.
- Users can click on the categories (Clothing, food, etc) to filter the product grid by type.
- Users can search for products and see an average rating of each product.
- Users can click on a product in the grid to view additional product details and rate the product. Navigation is via a React Router.
- Users can click to expand the shopping cart in the left navigation.
- Users can click the '+' button on a product cart to increment that product in the shopping cart.
- Users can click the '-' button on a product cart to decrement that product in the shopping cart.
- Shopping cart displays a table of products, quantities, subtotal, tax, and total.
- Users can check out and view the list of all past orders.
- Users can click on the top navigation bar to scroll to the relevant section.
- Users can see a "No products available" display when searching for a nonexistent product.
